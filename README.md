# Mikes-Server-Discord-Bot

Discord Bot for "Mike's Server"

Currently contains moderation features but games and random fun stuff will be added shortly

## If you would like to use the code for this bot for your own bot follow these steps:

1. Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok) up to 6:02
2. Replace ```TOKEN``` (line 215) with your bot's token (KEEP YOUR TOKEN SECRET)
3. Look for all the undefined variables (list below) and replace them with appropriate values (e.g an image url for ```logo_url```)
4. Copy the code you want to use (you MUST include lines 1-31 and line 215)
5. Ask me questions in [ISSUES](https://github.com/Simply-Cubing/Mikes-Server-Discord-Bot/issues)

### List of undefined varaibles 
If a variable begins with ```python
(int(os.environ["something"])``` replace it with any valid variable

### For all ```color``` variables (excluding ln 207 and 208), you may use any color of choice, but they need to be entered in a certain form:
1. Use [this](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) link to get your desired color in **HEX**
2. Replace the "#" at the start with "0x" or use my [discord color converter](https://github.com/Simply-Cubing/Mikes-Server-Discord-Bot/blob/main/discord-colour-converter.py)
