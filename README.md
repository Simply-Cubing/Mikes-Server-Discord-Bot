# Mikes-Server-Discord-Bot

Discord Bot for "Mike's Server"

Currently contains moderation features but games and random fun stuff will be added shortly

## If you would like to use the code for this bot for your own bot follow these steps:

1. Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok) up to 6:02
2. Replace ```TOKEN``` (line 215) with your bot's token
3. Look for all the undefined variables (list below) and replace them with appropriate values (e.g an image url for ```logo_url```)
4. Copy the code you want to use (you MUST include lines 1-31 and line 215)
5. Ask me questions in [ISSUES](https://github.com/Simply-Cubing/Mikes-Server-Discord-Bot/issues)

### List of undefined varaibles 
```logo_url``` = replace ```"url``` with a valid image URL  

```MSG_ID``` and ```MSG_ID_2``` replace with a [discord message id](https://www.followchain.org/copy-message-id-discord/)  

```PING_ROLE_ID```, ```POLL_ROLL```, ```VERIFIED```,```JOINED``` replace with a valid [discord role id](https://www.itgeared.com/how-to-get-role-id-on-discord/)  

```Id1``` replace with a valid [discord user id](https://www.remote.tools/remote-work/how-to-find-discord-id#)  

For ```url``` in line 200 replace it with your desired URL  

### For all ```color``` variables, you may use any color of choice, but they need to be entered in a certain form:
1. Use [this](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) link to get your desired color in **HEX**
2. Replace the "#" at the start with "0x" or use my [discord color converter](https://github.com/Simply-Cubing/Mikes-Server-Discord-Bot/blob/main/discord-colour-converter.py)
